      <p>The IT admin or team where you work should be able to support you, so contact them if possible. </p>

        <p>If you cannot contact them right now, there are some things you can try.</p> 
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Clear your cookies</h2>
          <p>Sometimes a cookie stored on your device can stop you from accessing a website. Deleting it can often resolve the problem.</p> 
          <p>To do this, go back to the Send an SR1 Form page and follow these steps:</p>

          
           
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                                       
            <li>Move your cursor to the address bar at the top of the screen.</li>
            <li>Click the padlock icon at the beginning of the web address (https://gov.uk...).</li>
            <li>Select Cookies from the drop-down menu. This will give you a list of cookies in use. </li>
        
            <li>Select the cookie listed below the sentence "The following cookies were set when you viewed this page".</li>
            <li>Click the Remove button followed by Done (do not click Block).</li>
          
          </ol>
          <p>You should be able to log on to the SR1 service now, but you might have to repeat these steps next time. </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Use a different browser</h2>
          <p>If you’re using Edge, try accessing the SR1 service using Chrome. To open Chrome, go to your device's start menu and look for the Chrome logo. </p>


          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Check your role is authorised</h2>

   

      <p>Only these job roles are authorised to complete an SR1 form:</p>

      
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>GP</li>
  <li>hospital consultant</li>
  <li>specialty doctor</li>
  <li>hospice doctor</li>
  <li>senior specialist nurse (such as a clinical nurse specialist, advanced nurse practitioner or similar)</li>

</ul>
<p>Your job role is checked against the job role on your NHS smartcard. If you should have access to this service, make sure your smartcard is correct. If it’s wrong, your IT support team will be able to help.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account to log incidents with the <a href="https://www.nhscfhservicedesk.nhs.uk%5D,">NHS National Service Desk</a> call 0300 303 5035.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you still cannot log on to the SR1 service</h2>

<p>You can complete PDF versions of the SR1 and the fee claim forms online. They do not need to be signed, but you’ll need to return them to us from a secure email address. Any email that does not come from a secure email address will be automatically deleted.</p>

<p>Secure email addresses end in:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><kbd>@nhs.net</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>@nhs.uk</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>@nhs.scot</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>@nhs.wales.uk</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>@gov.uk</kbd></li> 
  </ul>

<p>Send the request for a PDF version of the SR1 form, and fee claim form if needed, from your secure email address to <a href="#">form.e-sr1@dwp.gov.uk.</a></p>
<p>Please include your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>surgery /hospital /postal address</li>
  <li>phone number</li>

 
</ul>

<p>Do not encrypt any part of this email.</p>
