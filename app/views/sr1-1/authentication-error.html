      <p>If you’re using Edge, try changing to a different browser such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Opera. Then launch the SR1 service again.</p>
        <p>If you still cannot log in, contact your IT department.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can complete a PDF version of the SR1 form and the fee claim form which you can email back to us.</p>

      <p>The PDF versions do not need to be signed, but you’ll need to return them to us from a secure email address. Any email that does not come from a secure email address will be automatically deleted.</p>

      <p>Secure email addresses end in:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><kbd>@nhs.net</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>@nhs.uk</kbd></li>

        <li><kbd>@gov.uk</kbd></li> 
        </ul>
      
        <p>Send the request for a PDF version of the SR1 form, and fee claim form if needed, from your secure email address to <a href="#">form.e-sr1@dwp.gov.uk.</a></p>
      <p>Please include your:</p>

        <li>surgery/hospital/postal address</li>
        <li>phone number</li></ul>
